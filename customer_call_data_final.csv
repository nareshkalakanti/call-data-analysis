Synchronous Call: The recommender.recommend function is called directly with obj.dict() as the argument. This means the function will run synchronously, and the endpoint will wait for it to complete before sending the response.
Error Handling: Added a basic try-except block to catch exceptions from the recommender.recommend function. This is important because, unlike background tasks, synchronous function calls will directly affect the response of the API endpoint. If the function raises an exception, it's caught, and an HTTP 500 error is returned.
Logging: The result of the recommender.recommend call (or the error, if one occurs) is printed out. This allows you to see the output or error directly in the console where your FastAPI application is running, which can be helpful for debugging.
",General question,3 minutes,"Debugging Tips:
Use Print Statements: As shown, print statements can be very useful for debugging. You might print inputs and outputs within the recommender.recommend function.
Debuggers: Depending on your development environment (IDE), you might use a debugger to set breakpoints and inspect variables at runtime. This is more powerful than print statements because it allows you to pause execution and inspect the state of your program.
Logging: For more complex applications, consider using Python's built-in logging module to log messages instead of printing. Logs can be configured to show different levels of detail (info, debug, error, etc.) and can be written to a file for later analysis.
By running tasks synchronously in this manner, you gain immediate feedback on their execution, which can greatly aid in debugging. However, remember to revert these changes or use conditional logic to determine when to run tasks in the background versus synchronously, especially before deploying your application to production, as synchronous tasks can block your API responses and affect scalability.

Synchronous Call: The recommender.recommend function is called directly with obj.dict() as the argument. This means the function will run synchronously, and the endpoint will wait for it to complete before sending the response.
Error Handling: Added a basic try-except block to catch exceptions from the recommender.recommend function. This is important because, unlike background tasks, synchronous function calls will directly affect the response of the API endpoint. If the function raises an exception, it's caught, and an HTTP 500 error is returned.
Logging: The result of the recommender.recommend call (or the error, if one occurs) is printed out. This allows you to see the output or error directly in the console where your FastAPI application is running, which can be helpful for debugging.
",Issue with product,9 minutes,"Debugging Tips:
Use Print Statements: As shown, print statements can be very useful for debugging. You might print inputs and outputs within the recommender.recommend function.
Debuggers: Depending on your development environment (IDE), you might use a debugger to set breakpoints and inspect variables at runtime. This is more powerful than print statements because it allows you to pause execution and inspect the state of your program.
Logging: For more complex applications, consider using Python's built-in logging module to log messages instead of printing. Logs can be configured to show different levels of detail (info, debug, error, etc.) and can be written to a file for later analysis.
By running tasks synchronously in this manner, you gain immediate feedback on their execution, which can greatly aid in debugging. However, remember to revert these changes or use conditional logic to determine when to run tasks in the background versus synchronously, especially before deploying your application to production, as synchronous tasks can block your API responses and affect scalability.
